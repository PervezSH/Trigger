Simple First Person Shooting Game

It's a level-based game, where the player needs to complete the level within the given frame of time tackling enemies that are programmed to shoot the player and also dodging traps.
Till now, I added only three guns, a pistol, a shotgun, and an assault rifle.
Some important features:
- AI Enemy that tracks the Player and shoots
- Barrel that explodes on shooting
- Flame as traps
- Slow-mo: It's an item that gives the player the ability to slow time
- Wall running mechanism

On top of this, I also added interstitial ad and video ad, which allow the user to buy inventory items like extra health, extra slow-mo, and time. The ads are both skippable and non-skippable. Non-skippable ads are rewarded ads.
